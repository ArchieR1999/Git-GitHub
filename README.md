# Things to practice right now!!!!
Create a git repo from GitHub

1. practice making a change from the GitHub remote repo and fixing local conflicts. First off, git pull from the GitHub remote repo. Make your changes. Then push. Practice when GitHub is ahead or different. Then you must merge with what you have, make the changes, then push to GitHub.

2. practice making a change in the local Git repo and pushing a change to the main branch. Esepcially when the main branch is not on par with yours. 

3. practice making more branches in the local repository and merging them with different stages of dev (feature, branch, main) without errors. 

4. practice git fetch command and git pull especially in this instance. Doing this in a practice repo to save headache. 

5. practice deleting git branches from the bash terminal. So create a couple and detele them as deleting on GitHub will not necessarily delete them from bash terminal. 

6. practice merging from the feature branch then to the debvelop branch. Finally after some dvelopments, merge into main and see how that works. Try to get it working with no errors.
